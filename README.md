- 7 segment LED Display (converted binary password inputs into visualizations on the LED screen)
- allowed for input of HEXADECIMAL characters: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F} 
- system mode would start at unlocked and ask for user to create a password
- with a pushbutton, user could transfer between password input, locked, unlocked, password change modes
